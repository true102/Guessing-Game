**ðŸŽ® A Fun Guessing Game in Python ðŸš€**

I've created a simple yet engaging number guessing game using Python! The program generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the player guesses the number. If they guess correctly, they win; otherwise, they're prompted to try again. It's a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates basic Python concepts such as:

âœ… Using the random module
âœ… Handling user input
âœ… Conditional statements (if-else)
âœ… Converting data types

This project is perfect for anyone starting their Python journey or exploring how to build interactive console applications.
